# Crystal-hunter

Player chooses crystals preassigned random values at the start of each game to  hit target number.

Here's how the game works:

Choose crystals displayed page and alert will pop out will add crystal value to total score displayed. Deduce the value of each crystal with math.

You win by matching total score matches the target number. A surprise notifies you!

If you exceed the target... so sad you lose.

The game may be reset with the button. A new target will appear and crystal values will be different.

Come and play!
